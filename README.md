# Business-Insights-MySQL
## Problem statement:
Atliq Hardware is struggling to handle its increasing sales data due to frequent Excel crashes. To overcome this issue, there's a need for a user-friendly MySQL tool that can efficiently manage and analyze the expanding data for better business insights and smooth operations.
## Understanding the Business Model:
So atliq hardware produce computer peripherals so they sell the hardware  to different customers from there it will go to the consumers,here cusotmer is the store who sells the products tot he consumer who uses it .
they have a ware house where they build all these parts and they sell it different countries from there and from there the material or the hard ware will go the individual stores or customers.
here we have 2 different type  of platforms one is brick and mortar which is a physical store and the other is e commerce which is online platform
when you sell the hardware to a brick and mortar store and they sell it to the consumer then it is called as retailer, in addition to this atliq has also have their own store .now this channel is called direct , and also we have another channel which is a distriutor who sells the hardware to a local store .
### The P & L Statement goes like thisðŸ’°
- **Gross price:** this is the base price
- **pre-invoice sales:**  yearly discount agreements are made at the beginning  of each financial year.
- **Net invoice sales:** after deducting the pre-invoice from gross price .
- **Post-invoice deductions:** these are some additional discounts given by the atliq hardware to the store.
- **Net Sales(NS):** basically this is the revenue of the hardware.
- **Cost of Goods Sold(COGS):** these are the cost bared by the hardware like "manufacturing cost","freight cost","other costs" etc..
- **Gross Margin(GM):** Profit
- **Gross Margin % of Net Sales(GM/NS):** profit percentage.
## Approach:
here we will be exploring the database given to us
### Database Design:
